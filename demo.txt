Scientists have built a DNA-analysing smartphone attachment that is a fraction of the cost of lab-based kit.
The creators of the phone-powered pathology microscope believe it could be mass produced for less than $500 (Â£406) a unit.
They say it could help doctors treat cancer, tuberculosis and other diseases more effectively than is sometimes possible in the developing world.
But a UK firm says it is developing a more advanced and cheaper alternative.
Details of the peer-reviewed project are published in the journal Nature Communications.
Drug resistance
The prototype microscope attachment was 3D-printed and developed as a joint effort by the University of California, Stockholm University and Uppsala University.
One of the researchers involved said the tech could help medics examine tissue samples without having to send them to what might be a remote laboratory.
"It can use the information that is carried in our DNA to make diagnoses," Prof Mats Nilsson told the BBC.
"There are two main areas where this is done today.
"In cancer, where certain mutations in tumours confer resistance to drugs, it can be used to prescribe the right treatments.
